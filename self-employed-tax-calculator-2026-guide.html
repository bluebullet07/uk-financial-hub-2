          <p><strong>You made £50,000 as a freelancer this year with £8,000 in expenses.</strong></p>
          <p>But how much tax will you actually pay?</p>
          <p>Between income tax (£5,886), Class 2 NI (£179), and Class 4 NI (£2,654), you'll owe HMRC <strong>£8,719</strong> — that's 20.8% of your profit gone. Yet most self-employed people don't calculate this until their Self Assessment deadline.</p>
          <p>In this guide, I'll show you exactly how self-employed tax is calculated in 2026, what HMRC doesn't make obvious, and how to use a tax calculator to avoid overpaying or facing penalties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Self-Employed Tax Calculations Matter More Than Ever in 2026</h2>
        
        <p>The UK tax system for self-employed has become increasingly complex:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal allowance frozen</strong> until 2028 (stealth tax)</li>
          <li><strong>Class 2 & 4 NI rates changed</strong> from previous years</li>
          <li><strong>Payment on account</strong> catches many by surprise</li>
          <li><strong>Stricter HMRC scrutiny</strong> on expense claims</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In 2026, smart self-employed individuals aren't just asking <em>"How much will I earn?"</em></p>
        
        <p>They're asking:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What's my <strong>real take-home</strong> after all tax and NI?</li>
          <li>How much should I <strong>save monthly</strong> for tax bills?</li>
          <li>Should I use the <strong>trading allowance</strong> or actual expenses?</li>
          <li>When does it make sense to <strong>switch to limited company</strong>?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A reliable UK self-employed tax calculator 2026 answers these questions instantly.</p>

        <h2>What Is Self-Employed Tax?</h2>
        
        <p>Unlike PAYE employees who have tax automatically deducted, self-employed individuals pay three separate components:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Income Tax</strong> — 20%, 40%, or 45% on profit above £12,570</li>
          <li><strong>Class 2 National Insurance</strong> — £3.45/week (£179.40/year) if profit over £6,725</li>
          <li><strong>Class 4 National Insurance</strong> — 9% on profits £12,570-£50,270, then 2% above</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key difference from employees:</strong> You pay both Class 2 AND Class 4 NI, whereas employees only pay Class 1 NI.</p>

          <h4>💡 Key Insight</h4>
          <p>Income tax is calculated on your <strong>profit</strong> (turnover minus expenses), not your total turnover. This is why expense tracking is crucial!</p>

        <p><strong>Class 2 NI:</strong> Flat £3.45 per week (£179.40 annually) if your profit exceeds £6,725. This gives you State Pension credits and access to certain benefits.</p>

        <p><strong>Class 4 NI:</strong> Percentage-based on your profits:</p>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Throwing away receipts or not tracking expenses properly</p>
            <p><strong>The cost:</strong> Missing £5,000 in expenses = £1,000-2,000 extra tax</p>
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Use expense tracking app or cloud storage. Keep records for 5 years.</p>
